# minecraft-random-dungeon-gen
A random dungeon generator for Minecraft

It generates a very large box, that has 25 floors.
It takes around 25 minutes to complete (still Beta!!!)

IMPORTANT: Generation is very resource intensive. Expect large drops in TPS and high CPU usage.



# How to use:

NOTE: I suggest using a void world preset, to minimalize lag!

Navigate to your .minecraft folder

Navigate to "saves"

Select your desired world

Drop the folder "Periapt 1.1" into the "datapacks" folder

Enter the Minecraft world

Type "/datapack list" to see if it is enabled.

If it is, type "/function abc:1world_setup"

You should recieve a spawn egg, named "Dungeon Corner"

Place it at the NW corner of your dungeon (Y-value does not matter)

Type /function abc:2dungeon_prep

The dungeon is now generating. Expect extreme lag.
